# Render service configuration for "Create a new service from repo"
# This file provides a minimal configuration to build and start the app on Render.
# IMPORTANT: Set `SECRET_KEY` in the Render dashboard (do NOT commit secrets here).

services:
  - type: web
    name: osei-serwaa-kitchen
    branch: main
    runtime: node
    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
    startCommand: npm start
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
      - key: SECRET_KEY
        value: ""
      - key: DATABASE_PATH
        value: ./server/database.sqlite

# Notes:
# - Free plan: Render instances have ephemeral filesystem; the SQLite file
#   will not be reliably persisted across deploys or instance restarts.
# - For production persistence: upgrade the service or use a managed DB
#   (Postgres, MySQL) and set a connection string environment variable.
